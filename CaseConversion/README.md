This problem I have seen a few times. It's the case conversion problem.

Problem #1 - Convert snake case to camel case. 

e.g.    accounting_books_total = accountingBooksTotal
        error_code = errorCode
        first_name = firstName

Problem #2 - Convert camel case to snake case. 

e.g.    accountingBooksTotal = accounting_books_total
        errorCode = error_code
        Error = error
        firstName = first_name
