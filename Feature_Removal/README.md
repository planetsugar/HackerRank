This technical test was given to me in 2013. It was to be written in C#. My C# solution was terrible. 
=====================================================================================================

ASCII text file “Features.txt” contains 275,776 pole features with a couple of attributes, keyed by UDB
Number (the first field). The “FeaturesToDelete.txt” file contains 10,000 randomly selected UDB
numbers from “Features.txt”. Create an application that produces a new text document containing
the records from “Features.txt” whose UDB numbers are not in “FeaturesToDelete.txt”.

Additional Notes:
- This deliverable must be written in C#, you are free to choose the user interface application
type.
- Faster-performing solutions are preferred, as time permits;
- Please annotate key implementation decisions in comments within the sample code.
- Although the “Features.txt” file is relatively small in this example, the program should perform well in situations where this file may grow to many Gigabytes in size.

script1 and script2 are my javascript solutions. :-)
